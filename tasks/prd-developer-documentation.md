# PRD: Developer Documentation for `cleaner-node` Package

## Introduction/Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance the developer documentation for the `cleaner-node` package. The current documentation is limited to a summary within a `README.md` file, lacking detailed explanations and examples for each function. This improvement aims to provide comprehensive documentation that AI tools can parse and utilize effectively.

## Goals
- Provide detailed documentation for each function exposed in the `index` file or when importing the package.
- Ensure documentation is structured in a way that AI tools can understand and generate code based on it.

## User Stories
- As an AI tool, I want to access detailed documentation for each function in the `cleaner-node` package so that I can generate accurate and efficient code.
- As a developer, I want to find clear examples and explanations for each function to understand how to use the package effectively.
- As a developer, I want tools such as cursor IDE to be able to properly index and understand the cleaner node library and its functions so that they may effectively generate code utilizing the cleaner node functions without needing to be corrected.

## Functional Requirements
1. Each function must have a dedicated Markdown file under the `/docs` folder.
2. Documentation should include:
   - A detailed explanation of the function's purpose.
   - Input parameters and expected output.
   - Example usage scenarios.
   - Any edge cases or common pitfalls.
3. Ensure each file is small and focused on a single function call.
4. Include links to related documentation files where necessary.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No areas of the `cleaner-node` package are excluded from this documentation effort.

## Design Considerations
- Use Markdown for documentation.
- Maintain a proper file structure under the `/docs` folder.
- Ensure each file links to other relevant files.

## Success Metrics
- Each function is documented in a way that AI tools can parse and understand.
- Documentation is clear, concise, and provides examples for each function.

## Open Questions
- Are there any specific AI tools that should be prioritized for compatibility?
- Is there a preferred style guide for the documentation?
